# Cancer Prediction Using Logistic Regression

This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting cancer using logistic regression. The dataset used is `cancer.csv`, and the implementation is done in Python using Jupyter Notebook.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model for classifying cancer cases using logistic regression. The model is trained on labeled data and evaluated for accuracy.

## Files in the Repository
- `cancer.csv` - The dataset containing cancer-related data.
- `cancer_prediction_logistic_regression.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook containing data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation.
- `README.md` - This file provides an overview of the project.

## Dependencies
To run the Jupyter Notebook, install the following dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iidst-org/Cancer_prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Cancer_prediction
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook cancer_prediction_logistic_regression.ipynb
   ```
4. Run the cells in sequence to train and evaluate the model.

## Model Details
- **Algorithm**: Logistic Regression
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- **Libraries Used**: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

## Results
The model performance is evaluated using accuracy and other metrics. The results are visualized in the notebook.
